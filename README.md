## 1. WhatsApp Integration Layer
- **WhatsApp Business API**: Handles sending/receiving messages.
- **Webhook Endpoint**: Receives and processes incoming messages.

## 2. Bot & Conversation Engine
- **Bot Framework**: Manages dialog state, user sessions, and intent routing (send/receive DOT).
- **NLP Module**: Optionally parses free-form user queries (e.g., "I want to send 10 DOT to Alice").
- **Authentication**: Verifies user identity (OTP, PIN, or KYC).

## 3. Transaction Logic Layer

### Transaction Manager
- Handles both send and receive operations.
- Processes peer-to-peer DOT transfers between users.
- Manages transaction queues and status tracking.

### Address Manager
- Validates Polkadot addresses.
- Maintains address book for frequent contacts.
- Generates QR codes for receiving DOT.

### Fee Calculator
- Fetches current network fees.
- Calculates transaction costs.
- Provides fee estimates before confirmation.

### Polkadot Wallet Integration
- Manages DOT address creation and balance checks.
- Handles transaction signing and broadcasting.
- Monitors transaction confirmations on-chain.

## 4. Data Layer
- **User Database**: Stores profiles, KYC, wallet addresses, and contact lists.
- **Transaction Database**: Tracks all send/receive operations, status, and history.
- **Wallet Database**: Maintains DOT wallet info and keys per user.

## 5. Security Layer
- **Encryption**: For sensitive data, especially wallet private keys.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can initiate transactions.
- **Transaction Limits**: Daily/per-transaction limits for security.
- **Multi-signature Support**: Optional for high-value transfers.
- **Audit Logging**: All transactions and critical actions.

## 6. Notification & Support Layer
- **Transaction Notifications**: Sends confirmations, incoming transfer alerts, and status updates via WhatsApp.
- **Balance Alerts**: Notifies users of account activity.
- **Customer Support Bot**: Handles FAQs, transaction issues, and escalations.

## 7. Monitoring & Admin Layer
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manages users, monitors transactions, and handles compliance.
- **Monitoring/Alerts**: Tracks suspicious activity, failed transactions, network issues.
- **Analytics**: Transaction volumes, user activity, system health.

## Example Data Flow

### Sending DOT
1. User initiates "Send DOT" request via WhatsApp.
2. Webhook triggers bot engine, which authenticates user.
3. Bot collects transaction details (amount, recipient address).
4. Transaction Manager validates recipient address and checks sender's balance.
5. Fee Calculator estimates network fees and total cost.
6. User confirms transaction details.
7. Polkadot Wallet Integration signs and broadcasts transaction.
8. Bot monitors transaction confirmation on-chain.
9. Bot sends confirmation to sender and notification to recipient (if registered user).

### Receiving DOT
1. User requests their DOT address or generates QR code.
2. Bot provides address and monitors incoming transactions.
3. When DOT is received, Polkadot Wallet Integration detects the transfer.
4. Bot sends notification to user with transaction details.
5. Balance is updated in user's account.
